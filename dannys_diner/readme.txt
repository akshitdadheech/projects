---------- // Danny's Diner SQL Case Study \\ ----------

Overview:

This project involves a case study for Danny's Diner, a restaurant specializing in Japanese cuisine. The objective is to analyze customer data using SQL queries to derive insights for business decisions. The dataset provided includes three key tables: sales, menu, and members.

Problem Statements:

Danny, the owner of the diner, seeks answers to various questions about customer behavior, spending patterns, and menu popularity. The goal is to assist in decision-making, particularly regarding the expansion of the customer loyalty program.

Expertise Demonstrated (SQL Skills):

The project showcases a range of SQL skills, including:

* Joins: Utilized JOIN statements to combine data from different tables (sales, menu, members) based on common keys.

* Aggregation: Employed aggregate functions such as SUM and COUNT to derive meaningful insights from the data.

* Window Functions: Leveraged window functions like ROW_NUMBER() and DENSE_RANK() to analyze ordered data within partitions.

* Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Utilized CTEs to simplify complex queries, enhancing readability and maintainability.

Problem-Solving:

Each problem statement was addressed methodically, considering the specific requirements of Danny's Diner. The solutions provided clear and concise answers to the questions posed.

Queries Overview:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

Conclusion:

This SQL case study demonstrates strong skills in data analysis and query writing. By answering Danny's questions, it provides valuable insights for enhancing customer experience and loyalty programs at Danny's Diner. The use of SQL expertise and problem-solving abilities is evident throughout the project.
